# laravelMixTailindcss

A simple starter project for playing around with Tailwind and alpinejs in a proper PostCSS environment.

To get started:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sohel1999/laravelMixTailindcss.git  yourDreameProject

    cd yourDreameProject
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install

    # Using Yarn
    yarn
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm run dev

    # Using Yarn
    yarn run dev
    ```


## Building for production

Even though this isn't necessarily a starter kit for a proper project, we've included an example of setting up both [Purgecss](https://www.purgecss.com/) and [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/) to optimize your CSS for production.

To build an optimized version of your CSS, simply run:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run production

# Using Yarn
yarn run production
```
